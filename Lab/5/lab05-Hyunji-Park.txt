2.1) Inspecting a Directory
-Use the command ls to list the contents in your current directory
ls
-Now try ls -l to list the contents in your current directory in long format
ls -1
-Look at the man documentation of ls to find out how to list the contents in reverse order
ls -r -man
-How would you list the contents in long format arranged by time?
ls -1t
-Find out how to use the wildcard * to list all the files with extension .txt
ls -r *.txt
-Use the wildcard * to list all the files with extension .csv in reverse order
ls -r *.csv
-You can use the character ? to represent a single character: e.g. ls mid?.csv. Find out how to use the wilcard ? to list .csv files with names made of 4 characters (e.g. mid1.csv, snow.csv)
ls ????.csv
-The command ls *[1]*.csv should list .csv files with names containing the number 1 (e.g. mid1.csv, minutes1.csv). Adapt the command to list .csv files with names containing the number 2.
ls *[2]*.csv
