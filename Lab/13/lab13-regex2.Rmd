> ### Learning Objectives
>
> - String manipulation
> - Base R functions for strings
> - Work with the package `"stringr"`
> - String manipulation
> - More practice with regular expressions


### General Instructions

- Write your descriptions, explanations, and code in an `Rmd` (R markdown) file.
- Name this file as `lab13-first-last.Rmd`, where `first` and `last` are your
first and last names (e.g. `lab13-gaston-sanchez.Rmd`).
- Knit your `Rmd` file as an html document (default option).
- Submit your `Rmd` and `html` files to bCourses, in the corresponding lab assignment.

```{r message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

## Data "Emotion in Text"

You'll be working with the data file `text-emotion.csv` available in bCourses,
in the folder containing this `Rmd`.

The original source is the data set "Emotion in Text" from the website
Crowd Flower Data for Everyone https://www.crowdflower.com/data-for-everyone/

```{r eval = FALSE}
# assuming data file is in the same directory of your Rmd
tweets <- read.csv('text-emotion.csv', stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```

The file contains four columns:

- `tweet_id`: tweet identifier
- `sentiment`: class or sentiment label
- `author`: username author of the tweet
- `content`: content of the tweet


Also, while you work on this lab you may want to look at the cheat-sheets for:

- `"stringr"` cheatsheet (see bCourses)

- regular-expressions cheatsheet (see bCourses)


-----


### 1.1) Author (usernames)

According to Twitter, usernames: 

- cannot be longer than 15 characters

- can only contain alphanumeric characters (letters A-Z, numbers 0-9) with the 
exception of underscores (i.e. cannot contain any symbols, dashes or spaces, 
except underscores)

- _If you want to know more about twitter usernames, visit:_

https://help.twitter.com/en/managing-your-account/twitter-username-rules


### 1.2) Your Turn: author names

Confirm that the values in column `author` follow each of the rules for valid usernames:

a) No longer than 15 characters _(if you find usernames longer than 15 characters, display them)_

```{r}
# your code
sum(str_count(tweets$author) <= 15)
```


b) Contain alphanumeric characters and underscores. If you find usernames containing other symbols, display them. _Hint_: The non-word character class is `"\\W"` is your friend.

```{r}
# your code
sum(str_detect(tweets$author, "\\W+"))
tweets$author[which(str_detect(tweets$author, "\\W+"))]
```


c) What is the number of characters of the shortest usernames? And what are the names of these authors? _(write commands to answer these questions)_

```{r}
# your code
min(str_count(tweets$author))
tweets$author[which(str_count(tweets$author) == min(str_count(tweets$author)))]
```


-----


### 2) Your Turn: Various Symbols and Strings

Tweets contain all sorts of symbols: `!`, `?`, `%`, `$`, etc.

a) How many tweets contain at least one caret symbol `"^"` _(write a command to answer this question)_.

```{r}
# your code
sum(str_detect(tweets$content, "\\^"))
```


b) How many tweets contain three or more consecutive dollar symbols `"$"` _(write a command to answer this question)_.

```{r}
# your code
sum(str_detect(tweets$content, "\\${3,}"))
```


c) How many tweets do NOT contain the characters `"a"` or `"A"` _(write a command to answer this question)_.

```{r}
# your code
sum(!str_detect(tweets$content, "[aA]"))
```


d) Display the first 10 elements of the tweets that do NOT contain the characters `"a"` or `"A"` _(write a command to answer this question)_.

```{r}
# your code
tweets$content[!str_detect(tweets$content, "[aA]")][1:10]
```


e) Number of exclamation symbols `"!"`: compute a vector with the number of exclamation symbols in each tweet, and display its `summary()`.

```{r}
# your code
summary(sapply(str_extract_all(tweets$content, "!"), length))
```


f) What's the tweet (content) with the largest number of exclamation symbols `!`? Display its content. _(write a command to answer this question)_

```{r}
# your code
tweets$content[sapply(str_extract_all(tweets$content, "!"), length) == max(sapply(str_extract_all(tweets$content, "!"), length))]
```


-----


### 3) Your Turn: Valid Hashtags

People use the hashtag symbol `#` before a relevant keyword or phrase in their 
tweet to categorize those Tweets and help them show more easily in Twitter 
search. According to Twitter, hashtags cannot contain spaces or punctuation 
symbols, and cannot start with or use only numbers.

a) Count the number of (valid) hashtags in the tweet contents, and display a 
frequency `table()` of such counts.

```{r}
# your code
twt_hashtag <- str_extract_all(tweets$content, "#[:alpha:][:alnum:]*")
table(sapply(twt_hashtag, length))
```


b) Display such frequencies, and make a barplot of these counts
(i.e. number of tweets with 0 hashtags, with 1 hashtag, with 2 hashtags, etc).

```{r}
# your code
barplot(table(sapply(twt_hashtag, length)))
```


c) What is the average length of the unique hashtags? Do not count the hash `#`
symbol when determining the length.

```{r}
# your code
mean(str_count(unique(unlist(twt_hashtag))) - 1)
```


d) What is the most common length (i.e. the mode) of the hashtags?

```{r}
# your code
hashtag <- unlist(lapply(twt_hashtag, function(y) if (length(y) == 0) NULL else y[1]))
summary(str_count(hashtag) - 1)
table(str_count(hashtag) - 1)

```


-----


### 4) Tweets with OMG and omg

How many tweets contain the _individual_ strings `"omg"` or `"OMG"` _(write a command to answer this question)_. For example:

+ `omg I just saw them again`  (this would be a match)
+ `OMG I just saw them again`  (this would be a match)
+ `I just saw them again omg`  (this would be a match)
+ `I just saw them again OMG`  (this would be a match)
+ `I just saw them omg can't believe it`  (this would be a match)
+ `I just saw them OMG can't believe it`  (this would be a match)
+ `omg: I just saw them again`  (this would NOT be a match)
+ `OMG,I just saw them again`  (this would NOT be a match)
+ `I just saw them again omg!!!`  (this would NOT be a match)
+ `I just saw them again omgomgomg`  (this would NOT be a match)
+ `I just saw them again lol-omg!!!`  (this would NOT be a match)

```{r}
# your code
sum(str_detect(tweets$content, "^(omg|OMG)\\s|\\s(omg|OMG)\\s|\\s(omg|OMG)$"))
```

### 5.1) Table of Average Number of Patterns by Sentiment

The following diagram depicts a table in which the rows represent each of the
unique sentiments, and the columns represent averages of various patterns.

```{r out.width='80%', echo = FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('tweet-sentiment-freqs.png')
```


### 5.2) Your Turn: Average Patterns by Sentiment

Write code to create  (and display) a table (e.g. data frame, tibble, matrix) 
in which the rows correspond to the different types of sentiments, and the 
columns correspond to: 

1. average number of lower case letters
2. average number of upper case letters
3. average number of digits
4. average number of punctuation symbols 
5. average number of spaces 

_Hint: POSIX character classes are your friends._

```{r}
# your code

```
