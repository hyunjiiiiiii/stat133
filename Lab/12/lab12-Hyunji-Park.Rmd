## Introduction to Regular Expressions (Regex)

**Regular expression** also known as **Regex** is a tool for describing 
patterns in strings. While R provides a set of built-in functions for regex
pattern matching, I recommend that you use functions from `"stringr"` (part of
the _tidyverse_), which in turn is based on `"stringi"`. 


### Main `"stringr"` functions for regex

The goal of this lab is for you to get a first contact with the most common 
regex functions in `"stringr"` (see below), and to play a little bit with 
matching basic regex patterns (e.g. literal characters, escaping metacharacters,
using character sets, character classes, anchors, and quantifiers).

- `str_match()`
- `str_detect()`
- `str_extract()`
- `str_locate()`
- `str_sub()`
- `str_split()`
- `str_remove()`
- `str_replace()`


### Some common regex patterns

Here's a table with some of the common regex patterns:

__Lieteral Characters, Wildcard, and Anchors__

| Pattern  | Description     |
|:--------:|:---------------:|
| `abc`    | letters         |
| `123`    | digits          |
| `.`      | any chracter    |
| `\\.`    | literal dot     |
| `^a`     | starts with _a_ |
| `b$`     | ends with _b_   |


__Character Sets and Ranges__

| Pattern  | Description   |
|:--------:|:---------------:|
| `[abd]`  | only a, b, or c |
| `[^abc]` | not a, b, nor c |
| `[a-z]`  | characters a to z |
| `[A-Z]`  | characters A to Z |
| `[0-9]`  | numbers 0 to 9 |


__POSIX Classes__

| Pattern        | Description   |
|:--------:|:---------------:|
| `[[:digit:]]`  | any digit     |
| `[[:alpha:]]`  | any letter    |
| `[[:alnum:]]`  | any alpha-numeric |
| `[[:upper:]]`  | any lower case |
| `[[:lower:]]`  | any upper case |
| `[[:punct:]]`  | any punctuation |
| `[[:space:]]`  | any space     |
| `[[:xdigit:]]` | any hexadecimal digit |


__Abbreviated Character classes__

| Pattern  | Description   |
|:--------:|:---------------:|
| `\\d`    | any digit     |
| `\\D`    | any Non-digit |
| `\\w`    | any alphanumeric character |
| `\\W`    | any non-alphanumeric character |
| `\\s`    | any whitespace |
| `\\S`    | any Non-whitespace |


__Repetition and Quantifiers__

| Pattern | Description   |
|:--------:|:---------------:|
| `a{m}`   | _m_ repetitions of `"a"` |
| `a{m,n}` | _m_ to _n_ repetitions of `"a"` |
| `a*`     | zero or more repetitions of `"a"` |
| `a+`     | one or more repetitions of `"a"` |
| `a?`     | optional character `"a"` |

## 1) Data 

You will be working with the data set for the 
_Women's discus throw world record progression_, available in wikipedia:

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women%27s_discus_throw_world_record_progression>


The following code downloads the html file of the wikipedia page to your 
working directory: 

```r
# Download a copy of the HTML file, 
wiki = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/"
women_discus = "Women%27s_discus_throw_world_record_progression"
wiki_men_discus = paste0(wiki, women_discus)
download.file(wiki_men_discus, "women-discus-throw.html")
```

Assuming that you've downloaded the html content in the file 
`women-discus-throw.html`, run the following command to extract (i.e. scrape)
the contents of the HTML table into an R data.frame

```{r}
# extract HTML table into a data.frame
tables = readHTMLTable("women-discus-throw.html", header = TRUE)
dat = tables[[2]]
dim(dat)
```


### Data Cleaning

The main goal is to clean the downloaded data frame in order to produce a tidy 
data frame via string manipulations with regex. More specifically, the _clean_
data frame will have the following columns:

- `mark` (in meters)
- `first_name` (first name of athlete)
- `last_name` (last name of athlete)
- `initials` (name initials)
- `country` (name of country abbreviation)
- `day` (number of day)
- `month` (name of month)
- `year` (number of year)


-----


## 2) Extracting Mark (in meters)

The column `Mark` contains a character string with the record expressed 
both in meters and feet-inches. We want to extract only the value associated
to meters.

My suggestion is to always start small. In this case, you can get a subset of
values on which to test your regex patterns:

```{r}
tmp <- head(dat$Mark)
tmp
```

With the values in `tmp`, you can match the numeric values of meters with a 
pattern that matches a string __beginning__ with two digits, followed by a dot 
`"."`, followed by two more digits

```{r}
str_extract(tmp, "^[0-9][0-9]\\.[0-9][0-9]")
```


### 2.1) Your Turn: Meters

a) Use `str_extract()` with a pattern that matches a string __beginning__ with two 
digits, followed by a dot `"."`, followed by two more digits. Come up with 
three different regex patterns that meet these criteria.

```{r}
# your code for pattern 1
str_extract(tmp, "[0123456789][0123456789]\\.[0123456789][0123456789]")
```

```{r}
# your code for pattern 2
str_extract(tmp, "[[:digit:]][[:digit:]]\\.[[:digit:]][[:digit:]]")
```

```{r}
# your code for pattern 3
str_extract(tmp, "\\d\\d\\.\\d\\d")
```


b) Once you have a simple pattern, use it on the entire column `Mark` and get a
__numeric vector__ `mark`:

```{r}
# numeric vector mark
str_extract(dat$`Mark`, "^[0-9][0-9]\\.[0-9][0-9]")
```


-----


## 3) Extracting Athlete Name

The second task involves extracting the first and last names of the athletes. 
If you inspect the column `Athlete`, you will see that all its values are 
formed with the first name, the last name, and the country inside parenthesis:

```{r}
ath <- head(dat$Athlete)
ath
```


### 3.1) Your Turn: playe with `ath`

a) Work with the sample vector `ath` and try to `str_extract()` the first name.
You can experiment with the _word_ pattern `"\\w+"` (i.e. one or more 
alphanumeric characters):

```{r}
# your code (for first name)
str_extract(ath, "\\w+")
```


b) Now use the patterns _whitespace_ `"\\s"` and _word_ `"\\w+"` to attempt 
extracting the athlete's last name; to remove the extra matched space you can
use `str_trim()`

```{r}
# your code for the last name
str_trim(str_extract(ath, "[ ]\\w+"))
```


c) Once you are done working with `ath`, use your code to extract the first and 
last names of all athletes; use vectors `first_name` and `last_name` for this
purpose:

```{r}
# first and alst name of all athletes
str_extract(dat$`Athlete`, "\\w+")
str_trim(str_extract(dat$`Athlete`, "[ ]\\w+"))
```


### 3.2) Your Turn: Athlete's Initials

Use `first_name` and `last_name` to select the first letter in each vector
in order to form a new vector `initials` containing the initials of each 
athlete's name: e.g. `"J.T."`, `"T.L."`, `"G.H."`, etc.

```{r}
# initials vector
first_initial <-str_extract(dat$`Athlete`, "\\w")
last_initial <- str_trim(str_extract(dat$`Athlete`, "[ ]\\w"), side = "left")
paste0(paste(first_initial, last_initial, sep = "."), ".")
```


-----


## 4) Country

The column __Athlete__ also contains the athlete's country---abbreviated---within parenthesis:

```{r}
ath <- head(dat$Athlete)
ath
```


### 4.1) Your Turn: Athlete's country

a) Use `str_extract()` with a regex pattern that matches the country
abbreviation. Come up with three different regex patterns that let you get
these characters:

```{r}
# your code (pattern 1)
str_extract(ath, "[^\\s]+$")

```

```{r}
# your code (pattern 2)
str_extract(ath, "[(]\\w+[)]")
```

```{r}
# your code (pattern 3)
str_extract(ath, "[(][[:upper:]]+[)]")
```


b) Once you have the right pattern, use your code to extract the country
abbreviations on the entire column to produce a vector `country`

```{r}
# your country vector
str_extract(dat$`Athlete`, "[(]\\w+[)]")
```


-----


## 5) Date

The date values are in the column `Date`:

```{r}
dts <- head(dat$Date)
dts
```


### 5.1) Your Turn: play with `dts`

With the `dts` vector, extract in separate vectors the 
values of day, month name, and year: you can try using patterns such as 
`"[0-9]"`, `"\\d+"`, `"\\w+"`:

```{r}
# your code for days
str_extract(dts, "\\d+")
```

```{r}
# your code for months
str_trim(str_extract(dts, "\\D+"))
```

```{r}
# your code for years
str_trim(str_extract(dts, "[ ]\\d+"))
```


-----


## 6) Clean Data Frame

We are assuming that you have created vectors for all the cleaned components: 

- `mark` (in meters)
- `first_name` (first name of athlete)
- `last_name` (last name of athlete)
- `initials` (name initials)
- `day` (number of day)
- `month` (name of month)
- `year` (number of year)


### 6.1) Your Turn: assemble `discus`

Create a data frame `discus` with all the above vectors used as column of this
table. Display the `head()` and `tail()` of this table.

```{r}
# your code
discus <- data.frame(
  mark = str_extract(dat$`Mark`, "^[0-9][0-9]\\.[0-9][0-9]"),
  first_name = str_extract(dat$`Athlete`, "\\w+"),
  last_name = str_trim(str_extract(dat$`Athlete`, "[ ]\\w+")),
  initials = paste0(paste(str_extract(dat$`Athlete`, "\\w"), str_trim(str_extract(dat$`Athlete`, "[ ]\\w"), side = "left"), sep = "."), "."),
  day = str_extract(dat$`Date`, "\\d+"),
  month = str_trim(str_extract(dat$`Date`, "\\D+")),
  year = str_trim(str_extract(dat$`Date`, "[ ]\\d+"))
)
discus
```


-----


## 7) Your Turn: Timeline graph

Graph a timeline to visualize the progression of world records: use `year` 
for the x-axis, and `mark` for the y-axis

```{r}
# your code
ggplot(discus, aes(x = year, y = mark)) + geom_point() + theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle=45, hjust=1))
```


-----


## 8) Your Turn: Challenge

Write code (using a for-loop) to obtain a list `names_month` containing the 
athlete names, in alphabetical order, that set a world record in each month. 

For illustration purposes, here's what `names_month` should look like for the 
first three elements. Notice that the last name appears first, followed by a 
comma, and then the first name. Likewise, the names appear in alphabetical
order by last name.

```
$April
[1] "Melnik, Faina"

$May
[1] "Dumbadze, Nina"       "Jahl, Evelin"         "Konopacka, Halina"   
[4] "Melnik, Faina"        "Press, Tamara"        "Savinkova, Galina"   
[7] "Spielberg, Christine" "Wajs, Jadwiga"       

$June
[1] "Mauermayer, Gisela" "Melnik, Faina"      "Wajs, Jadwiga"     
[4] "Westermann, Liesel"
```

```{r}
# your code
discus <- mutate(discus, month_num = match(discus$month, month.name))
discus <- arrange(discus, last_name)

names_list <- list()

for (i in 4:11){
  names_list <- c(names_list,
                  list(paste(unique(filter(discus, month_num == i)$last_name), unique(filter(discus, month_num == i)$first_name), sep = ", ")))
}

names(names_list) <- c("April", "May", "June", "July", "Agust", "September", "October", "November")
names_list
```
